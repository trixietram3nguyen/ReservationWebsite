## Notes
I added 3 more branches named Trixie, Thai, and Erik so whenever you guys want to edit 
anything in our project, just go to your branch and work on it. Then you can merge it to the
main branch and push it to the repo later.

## Steps to get your branch sets up after clone the repo.
1. Go to the branch with your name (you should be able to find it under 'Current Branch').
2. Click 'Publish branch'
3. Then click on 'Create Pull Request'
4. It will direct you to github page
5. Then go to 'Pull requests' tab
6. On the 'base' side change 'main' to the name of your branch, and on the 'compare' side, 
change to 'main'. If it says something like 'There isn't anything to compare' then you are good 
to start working on the project. 
7. If not, you should have an option to click on 'Create pull request'
8. Then click 'Merge pull request'
10. Go back to Github Desktop. Look at the tab next to 'Current Branch', click 'pull origin', or 
click on the refresh icon if you don't see 'pull origin'
9. After that, you should be okay to work on the project. Make sure to go to your branch and 
go to the folder from your branch to work on the project. Then push and merge it with the main
branch before you close the project.

***Pull from main and merge it from main to your branch each time you start working on the project
by follow step 3-9.
