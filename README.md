## Notes
I added 3 more branches named Trixie, Thai, and Erik so whenever you guys want to edit 
anything in our project, just go to your branch and work on it. Then you can merge it to the
main branch and push it to the repo later.

## Steps to get your branch sets up after clone the repo.
1. Go to the branch with your name (you should be able to find it under 'Current Branch').
2. Click 'Publish branch'
3. Then click on 'Create Pull Request'
4. It will direct you to github page
5. Then go to 'Pull requests' tab
