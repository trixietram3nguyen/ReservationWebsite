## Notes
I added 3 more branches named Trixie, Thai, and Erik so whenever you guys want to edit 
anything in our project, just go to your branch and work on it. Then you can merge it to the
main branch and push it to the repo later.
I recommended to watch the videos first if you are new to this, it won't take long.
I also listed out the steps for push and pull I might miss some small details, but that is 
the idea.
- You guys can tried to get use to these by creating a text file in your local and edit it 
before you actually work on the project if you are not sure how these work.

## Steps to get your branch sets up after clone the repo.
1. Go to the branch with your name (you should be able to find it under 'Current Branch').
2. Click 'Publish branch'
3. Then click on 'Create Pull Request'
4. It will direct you to github page
5. Then go to 'Pull requests' tab
6. On the 'base' side change 'main' to the name of your branch, and on the 'compare' side, 
change to 'main'. If it says something like 'There isn't anything to compare' then you are good 
to start working on the project. 
7. If not, you should have an option to click on 'Create pull request'
8. Then click 'Merge pull request', 'Confirm merge'
9. Go back to Github Desktop. Look at the tab next to 'Current Branch', click 'pull origin', or 
click on the refresh icon if you don't see 'pull origin'
10. After that, you should be okay to work on the project. Make sure to go to your branch and 
go to the folder from your branch to work on the project. Then push and merge it with the main
branch before you close the project.

***Pull from main and merge it from main to your branch each time you start working on the project
by follow step 3-9.

## Steps to push your works onto the project and merge with the main branch
1. After working for a bit, you should save your work and go back to Github Desktop to push your 
works. When you go back to Github Desktop, it will automatically showing you changes. 
On the bottom left corner, just put the description of what you did/change there. Then click 
'Commit...'.
2. Then you will see 'Push origin' option appear, click on it.
3. Then click 'Create Pull Request'
4. This time make sure the left side is 'main' and the right side is your branch
5. Click 'Create pull request'
6. Click 'Merge pull request'
7. Click 'Confirm merge'
8. GO back to Github Desktop, make sure you are in 'main' branch.
9. Click 'Pull origin'

***Push to your branch frequently when you work on the project step 1-2. You can merge 
your branch to the main branch(step 3-8) before close the project or do it when you push 
your stuff into your branch. Double check to see if your new stuffs are in 'main' branch.
